# Introduction

**Notpron** (https://notpron.com/) is a long-running, web-based riddle/puzzle series that requires a mix of **logical reasoning**, **pattern recognition**, and basic **coding/scripting skills**. Players progress through numbered levels that present problems in many forms: image analysis, URL manipulation, hidden files, encoded text, and other puzzle mechanics.

If you're familiar with **Cicada 3301**, Notpron shares a spirit of mystery and multilayered puzzles — but it is generally far more approachable, especially in the early levels. The challenge is ideal for developers, hobby cryptographers, and anyone who likes to learn by solving.

**What you need**

- A web browser and willingness to inspect HTML and image sources. *(Note: Chromium-based browsers are not recommended, as they may sometimes behave differently with certain puzzles.)*
- Basic familiarity with text encodings (Base64, hex), URL structure, and simple scripting (e.g., JavaScript, Python) to automate repetitive checks.
- Curiosity and patience.

**Content warning**: Notpron often requires thinking outside the box. Levels may use clever tricks but do not require illegal or unsafe actions.

Good luck — enjoy the puzzle-solving process!

## Solution
Initially I wasted a couple of minutes trying to figure out if the image represented a pipe or if there was something hidden, in the end I realized that the page continued and at the end of the page there was a writing that said up

![Level 6 end page](../images/level6_end_page.png)

So what i did is go up a little bit and selecting the text i found some hidden numbers

![Level 6 decimals](../images/level6_decimals.png)

I immediately recognized that they were ASCII characters and so I started writing a simple python script to convert these numbers into characters

After that I clicked on the white circle on the pipe to enter the credentials for the next level and it gave me the suggestion 'anagram'

![Level 6 hint](../images/level6_hint.png)

So I started to make the anagram of the two words and I found the respective results (kill and zone), after that I entered them as username and password â€” and boom, level 6 completed!

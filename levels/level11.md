## Solution
As usual the first thing I did was inspect the source code and that's where I noticed that the image was called screen12.jpg and I found it very strange considering that I was at level 11

So what i did was replace screen12.jpg with screen11.jpg and that's where i found a new image

![Level 11 new image](../images/level11_real.png)

In the image there were two words, namely fucking and pans and I guessed they were the credentials, so I pressed the yellow circle in the image and entered the credentials â€” and boom, level 11 completed!

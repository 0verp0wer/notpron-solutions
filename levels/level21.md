# Level 21

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Solution
This level was particularly easy but would have taken a long time to solve manually and like always I opened the developer tools

![Level 21 inspected](../images/level21_inspected.jpg)

As you can see from the inspected code you see an image called white.jpg, in the start level image you can see some color names written, so I did the most obvious thing to do which was to replace white with the name of those colors and I got this:

![Level 21 blue](../images/level21_blue.jpg)

Each color is associated with an image containing a path and therefore the most obvious thing to do is to complete the path by joining the various images, but doing it manually would have taken too much time, so I created a python code that did it for me:

```python
import numpy as np

from PIL import Image

def remove_white(img):
    img = img.convert("RGBA")
    data = np.array(img)

    r, g, b, _ = data.T
    mask = (r > 240) & (g > 240) & (b > 240)

    data[..., 3][mask.T] = 0
    return Image.fromarray(data)

def overlap_images(images_list, output):
    base = None

    for path in images_list:
        img = Image.open(path)
        img = remove_white(img)

        if base is None:
            base = img
        else:
            base = Image.alpha_composite(base, img)

    base.save(output, format="PNG")

images = [
    "blue.jpg",
    "green.jpg",
    "orange.jpg",
    "red.jpg",
    "lilac.jpg",
    "yellow.jpg",
    "pink.jpg",
    "light_blue.jpg",
    "black.jpg"    
]

overlap_images(images, "result.png")
```

After running this code i got this image:

![Level 21 result](../images/level21_result.png)

And by following the various paths you get two words

![Level 21 result solved](../images/level21_result_solved.png)

Which are respectively getting and smarter, after that I clicked on the alpha symbol present in the initial image and entered the credentials â€” and boom, level 21 completed!

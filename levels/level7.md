## Solution
The first thing I did was open the developer tools to inspect the code and here I found two suggestions

![Level 7 inspected](../images/level7_inspected.png)

The suggestions lead to one conclusion: we need to find a candy with gold-colored paper that is Deutschland. Searching on the internet, the name came up, namely twix, so what i did was replace tieman.htm with twix.html

![Level 7 twix](../images/level7_twix.png)

The site contains the word wenoot which read backwards means too new, so what I did was search the internet for the old name of twix

![Level 7 twix old name](../images/level7_twix_old_name.png)

After finding out the old name was raider, i changed twix.htm to raider.htm

![Level 7 raider](../images/level7_raider.png)

The site contains the word dnuorayawrehto which when read backwards means other way around, so what I did was check the site's URL and noticed that the word sdrawkcab was present, which when read backwards means backwards, so I replaced raider in the URL with its reverse, namely rediar â€” and boom, level 7 completed!
